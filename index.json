[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. Together with my research group, I work on machine learning, which aims to automatically find solutions to problems by gaining experience (data) from interacting with the environment. I aim to improve three properties of ML methods:\n Automatic Machine Learning: Methods are too brittle, and require human design and oversight. Data efficiency: Making better predictions with less data. Uncertainty quantification and decision making: Uncertainty tells us when risks are worth taking.  Improvements in these areas would benefit the full spectrum of applications: from tasks with small amounts of data where eliminating noise is important, to high-dimensional large-data settings where neural networks are applied to natural data like images. To tackle these problems, I apply strong principles from statistics to machine learning models. Doing so requires developing accurate approximations to the statistical methods, as the exact computations are impossible to do. In terms of methods, I mainly work on Gaussian processes and neural networks (and the strong links between them).\nMy work has been presented at the leading machine learning conferences (NeurIPS and ICML), and includes a best paper award. Personally, I\u0026rsquo;m currently enthusiastic about our paper on learning what invariance should be used as an inductive bias for a dataset of interest.\nSee my Research Overview page for more details on my research interests.\nAcademic or Industrial Collaborations I am also interested in applied problems, and am keen to collaborate. While my research overview gives a more complete picture of topics, I wanted to give a special mention to problems where 1) signal needs to be distinguished from noise, 2) knowledge needs to be encoded into the model, or 3) data is scarce, or needs to be acquired intelligently. Tools like (deep) Gaussian processes can make a difference here, and recent developments have provided new capabilities of dealing with higher-dimensional inputs or large datasets. Current ongoing collaborations include tailored Bayesian optimisation models for biomolecular design or optimisation of chemical processes.\nIf you have a problem that fits these descriptions, please do get in touch. Collaborations can range from publishing case-studies or datasets which can serve as a community benchmark, to consulting, to methods research.\nWorking with me I will have spaces for a small number (~2) of PhD students a year in the next few years. I am looking for people with a strong academic background (particularly strong mathematical skills) who are keen to work on topics that are aligned with my interests. I have written up some tips and guidelines for applying, which I recommend you read before getting in touch or submitting your application.\nAbout Before starting at Imperial, I worked with Dr. James Hensman for two years as a machine learning researcher at Secondmind, a research-led startup aiming to solve a wide variety of decision making problems. I did my PhD in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, working with Prof. Carl Rasmussen, and completing my thesis in 2017. I was funded by the EPSRC and awarded a Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship for my final year. During my PhD, I occasionally worked as a machine learning consultant, and I also spent a few months as a visiting researcher at Google in Mountain View, CA. I moved to the UK from the Netherlands for my undergraduate degree in Engineering.\n Download my resumé. -- ","date":1641945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1641945600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Research I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London.

Applications involving tailored probabilistic models for e.g. Bayesian optimisation.  High-level aims and approach Our research aims to improve three broad properties of Machine Learning methods:\n Data efficiency: Making better predictions with less data. Automatic Machine Learning: Methods are too brittle, and require human design and oversight. Uncertainty quantification and decision making: Uncertainty tells us when risks are worth taking.  Improvements in these areas would benefit the full spectrum of applications: from tasks with small amounts of data where eliminating noise is important, to high-dimensional large-data settings where neural networks are applied to natural data like images.\nApproaches from statistics can help to improve these three areas, e.g. Bayesian modelling. Bayesian modelling is well-known for helping with quantifying uncertainty. This is important for decision making, since risk needs to be taken into account. If a self-driving car is 5% sure the road ahead is blocked, it can slow down to gain more information, or perform evasive action. If a \u0026ldquo;best guess\u0026rdquo; is given of \u0026ldquo;not blocked\u0026rdquo;, the consequences can be catastrophic. Bayesian deep learning aims to get better uncertainty estimates, and we do work on this.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;m more excited about an underappreciated ability of the Bayesian framework: automatic inductive bias selection. By developing this ability in neural networks, the design of network architecture could be automated. Deep learning would be much more practical if humans wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to make a multitude of design choices, like how many layers are needed, how wide they should be, their convolutional structure, and so on. Currently, these choices are made by cross-validation, which is basically trial-and-error where different versions of the network are trained from scratch. The Bayesian approach provides a single objective function that can be optimised to find architecture and weights at the same time. The long-term goal for this line of research, is to be able to determine the connectivity structure of neurons (because this is what architecture is), in a single training run of the network. This would vastly simplify network design.\nAnother hypothesis in the ML community is that simply scaling models to be larger will solve the three problems mentioned above, rather than improving training procedures. Approaches like meta-learning and large language models like GPT-3 push in this direction. This brings up its own interesting open questions that statistical reasoning can contribute to: What tasks and datasets should be used? Can knowledge about the mathematics of inference inform architecture design? How should methods be evaluated? These are certainly also interesting questions to investigate.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not completely sure what approach I would bet on. I certainly follow developments in meta-learning and large models carefully. If the answer to this was clear, this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be research. Luckily, there are interesting questions to investigate in both directions.\nResearch Highlights To give a more concrete idea of research we have done, here are some projects and papers roughly grouped together in themes. These projects were done together with collaborators and students, so do look at the papers themselves.\nLearning invariances Invariance and equivariance are very common inductive biases, with the ubiquitous convolutional layer being the most common example. When designing architectures, humans currently choose how many convolutional layers to use, together with parameters like filter size. Often these choices are made with a laborious trial-and-error procedure (cross-validation). To make the number of choices even larger, other types of convolutional layers have been developed in recent years, which help generalisation across different scales and rotations. The optimal inductive bias varies by problem and dataset, so it would be nice if we had an automatic procedure for determining these.\nWe are developing methods that allow weights and architecture to be learned at the same time, by optimising a single objective function. In our paper Learning Invariances using the Marginal Likelihood we expressed invariances as data augmentations, and learned the correct data augmentation parameters through backprop with a single optimisation run. The objective function was derived from the principles of Bayesian model selection1.\nThe final invariance can be visualised by looking at the samples that the data augmentation procedure generates. Samples generated for a particular input image visualise which transformations are seen as not changing the label (see figure below).\n Figure: Samples describing the learned invariance for some MNIST digits (squares). The method becomes insensitive to local rotations, shears, and rotations.  Overall, this procedure is a lot more convenient than training a model many times in a cross-validated grid search over the data augmentation parameters. What really shows that invariances are truly learned here, is that if you apply the same method to a dataset with different characteristics, a different invariance is learned. The same exact method that worked well on MNIST would learn almost full rotational invariance for rotated MNIST (see paper for results). Following the normal procedure, the cross-validated grid search would have to be performed again!\nThe method above was based on Gaussian processes, and we since have been working on neural network equivalents which learn different kinds of equivariant tied weights. Our workshop paper provided some nice GIFs of different kinds of convolutional structure being learned together with weights (see figure below).\n Figure: Learning rotationally equivariant filter structure starting from full connectivity. Note how the rotation of the filters increases as it learns the equivariant structure. Work in progress that is currently only available for shallow NNs.  What are the limitations?\n Currently it only works really robustly on shallow models (although we have had partial progress in deep models). You need to specify a solution space of invariances, from which the correct invariance is picked. All machine learning methods need to parameterise their solution space, but so far we have only parameterised simple ones like the space of distributions on affine transformations, and local deformations.  There is plenty of more to do!\nAccurate and Automatic Gaussian process approximations We also do nitty-gritty research to make Gaussian processes (a model that is also common in statistics) work really well. One neat property of GPs is that there are principles for selecting all their free parameters. In principle, this means that humans aren\u0026rsquo;t needed in the loop to train them.\nUnfortunately, to reduce computational complexity, approximations need to be introduced. These often introduce free parameters again, which then means that a human has to intervene to ensure that the quality of the approximation is acceptable. This defeats part of the point! We improved two GP approximations (variational and conjugate gradient) by providing:\n automatic procedures for selecting approximation parameters, and mathematical guarantees on the quality of the solution.  This helps the methods give solutions in a more computationally efficient manner, while also making them more accurate. These methods help give predictions that you can really trust.\nSee:\n Convergence of Sparse Variational Inference in Gaussian Process Regression (or the shorter conference version) Tighter Bounds on the Log Marginal Likelihood of Gaussian Process Regression Using Conjugate Gradients   In the search for faster GP approximations, I have also worked on variational bounds that do not require matrix inverses to be computed. While the maths works, getting the method to optimise quickly enough for it to actually provide a practical benefit is still difficult. I do think the results are neat, and that there is a lot more to be looked into here.\nDeep Gaussian processes Why is accurate Gaussian process inference important? Well, apart from GPs being useful for noisy and/or low-data tasks where quantifying uncertainty is important2, GPs are also a different representation of a neural network layer. It seems that there are advantages in terms of the quality of approximate Bayesian inference when representing a layer as a GP rather than with weights. One key research question is whether thinking about neural network layers as GPs can help bring the benefits of Bayesian inference (uncertainty and automatic model selection) to deep neural networks.\nThe evidence of this comes from the very first papers on deep GPs by Damianou \u0026amp; Lawrence, where the marginal likelihood estimate was already used for model selection. Simple inference methods keep this property, even as deep GP models become more complex.\nTechniques that accomplish similar things for neural networks are only now being developed. However, in some ways the approaches in deep GPs are simpler and easier, even if they are computationally expensive. I think that there is a significant opportunity for both classes of models to benefit from each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths. Deep links between deep GPs and deep neural networks are becoming clearer, and can provide a concrete way to get the best of both worlds.\nCapsules I do believe that good model structure is the most important property for good performance. When I first heard Geoff Hinton\u0026rsquo;s talk about capsule networks, I was very intrigued by the inductive bias specified by the network alone. In addition, there seems to be a lot of probabilistic inspiration behind the routing algorithm.\nTogether with Lewis Smith et al, we attempted to make a fully probabilistic formulation of capsule networks, which would allow routing to be derived directly from inference. Although our practical success was limited, the project did provide a lot of insight. I do still believe in the idea behind capsules and their link to probabilistic inference. Hopefully this won\u0026rsquo;t be our last project on the topic.\n  See David MacKay\u0026rsquo;s excellent textbook for a good intro.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Which is the case in many industrial and engineering problems.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1641254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641254400,"objectID":"68d5def351fb4241a87b2f02b7b1e96c","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/research-overview/","publishdate":"2022-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-overview/","section":"","summary":"High-level overview of research interests.","tags":null,"title":"Research Overview","type":"page"},{"authors":["Vincent Fortuin","Adrià Garriga-Alonso","Sebastian W.

They have been used to analyse the behaviour of finite networks, as well as being useful methods in their own right. When investigating infinitely wide convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it was observed that the correlations arising from spatial weight sharing disappear in the infinite limit. This is undesirable, as spatial correlation is the main motivation behind CNNs. We show that the loss of this property is not a consequence of the infinite limit, but rather of choosing an independent weight prior. Correlating the weights maintains the correlations in the activations. Varying the amount of correlation interpolates between independent-weight limits and mean-pooling. Empirical evaluation of the infinitely wide network shows that optimal performance is achieved between the extremes, indicating that correlations can be useful.","tags":[],"title":"Correlated weights in infinite limits of deep convolutional neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian W.

One crucial aspect of these models is an expectation that, because they are treated as Gaussian process models optimized using the marginal likelihood, they are protected from overfitting. However, we identify pathological behavior, including overfitting, on a simple toy example. We explore this pathology, explaining its origins and considering how it applies to real datasets. Through careful experimentation on UCI datasets, CIFAR-10, and the UTKFace dataset, we find that the overfitting from overparameterized deep kernel learning, in which the model is “somewhat Bayesian”, can in certain scenarios be worse than that from not being Bayesian at all. However, we find that a fully Bayesian treatment of deep kernel learning can rectify this overfitting and obtain the desired performance improvements over standard neural networks and Gaussian processes.","tags":[],"title":"The promises and pitfalls of deep kernel learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artem Artemev","David R.

The basis of our bound is a more careful analysis of the log-determinant term appearing in the log marginal likelihood, as well as using the method of conjugate gradients to derive tight lower bounds on the term involving a quadratic form. Our approach is a step forward in unifying methods relying on lower bound maximisation (e.g. variational methods) and iterative approaches based on conjugate gradients for training Gaussian processes.

Gaussian processes (GPs) provide uncertainty estimates and a marginal likelihood objective, but their weak inductive biases lead to inferior accuracy. This has limited their applicability in certain tasks (e.g. image classification). We propose a translation insensitive convolutional kernel, which relaxes the translation invariance constraint imposed by previous convolutional GPs. We show how we can use the marginal likelihood to learn the degree of insensitivity. We also reformulate GP image-to-image convolutional mappings as multi-output GPs, leading to deep convolutional GPs. We show experimentally that our new kernel improves performance in both single-layer and deep models. We also demonstrate that our fully Bayesian approach improves on dropout-based Bayesian deep learning methods in terms of uncertainty and marginal likelihood estimates.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Image Classification with Deep Convolutional Gaussian Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592265600,"objectID":"aac2a99afb0dfaaaa49710beab430480","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/talk/variational-gaussian-processes-without-matrix-inverses/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/variational-gaussian-processes-without-matrix-inverses/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Variational Gaussian Processes without Matrix Inverses","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591574400,"objectID":"1fcb602208c988fc924a4e59a3a03aff","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","section":"event","summary":"A tutorial on Bayesian model selection, and how it can be used to learn invariances using backprop.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Invariances using the Marginal Likelihood","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581897600,"objectID":"4c18add12979cbf05e72e53c41dc8460","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/learning-invariances-using-the-marginal-likelihood/","section":"event","summary":"Kernels provide a powerful way of encoding assumptions about the class of functions that should be used for a particular learning problem.

Inference in this setting has either employed computationally intensive MCMC methods, or relied on factorisations of the variational posterior. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the factorisation between latent system states and transition function can lead to a miscalibrated posterior and to learning unnecessarily large noise terms. We eliminate this factorisation by explicitly modelling the dependence between state trajectories and the low-rank representation of our Gaussian process posterior. Samples of the latent states can then be tractably generated by conditioning on this representation. The method we obtain gives better predictive performance and more calibrated estimates of the transition function, yet maintains the same time and space complexities as mean-field methods.","tags":[],"title":"Overcoming Mean-Field Approximations in Recurrent Gaussian Process Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Burt","Carl Edward Rasmussen","Mark van der Wilk"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664108279,"objectID":"c7391258d912362c54011419675fc404","permalink":"https://markvdw.github.io/publication/burt-2019-rates/","publishdate":"2022-09-25T12:18:24.549891Z","relpermalink":"/publication/burt-2019-rates/","section":"publication","summary":"Excellent variational approximations to Gaussian process posteriors have been developed which avoid the $mathcalOłeft(N^3i̊ght)$ scaling with dataset size $N$. They reduce the computational cost to $mathcalOłeft(NM^2g̊ht)$, with $Młl N$ the number of inducing variables, which summarise the process. While the computational cost seems to be linear in $N$, the true complexity of the algorithm depends on how $M$ must increase to ensure a certain quality of approximation. We show that with high probability the KL divergence can be made arbitrarily small by growing $M$ more slowly than $N$. A particular case is that for regression with normally distributed inputs in D-dimensions with the Squared Exponential kernel, $M=mathcalO(łog^D N)$ suffices. Our results show that as datasets grow, Gaussian process posteriors can be approximated cheaply, and provide a concrete rule for how to increase $M$ in continual learning scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Rates of Convergence for Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
